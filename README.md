The "Coffee Orders Analysis Dashboard" project involved an in-depth analysis of coffee sales, order trends, and profitability within a caf√© or coffee shop setting. By leveraging data analysis in Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI, the project uncovered critical business insights, including:
- **Sales & Profit Analysis**: A thorough evaluation of total coffee sales and profitability was conducted to understand revenue generation and profit margins.

- **State-wise Sales**: Sales data was analyzed based on different locations, helping to identify high-performing areas and optimize supply chain strategies
- **Category-wise Profit**: The profitability of different coffee categories (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino) was examined to identify high-margin and low-margin products.
- **Top 5 Subcategories by Sale**: The project identified the top-performing coffee items in terms of sales, highlighting customer preferences and demand trends.
- **Pie Chart Analysis of Ecommerce Sales**: A pie chart was used to visually represent the distribution of coffee sales, providing an intuitive overview of the share of different coffee types

- **Sales, Profit, Quantity, Order, Profit Margin Analysis**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profit, quantity sold, order volume, and profit margin were analyzed to provide a holistic view of the business performance.

The Coffee Orders Analysis Dashboard successfully enabled a data-driven decision-making approach for optimizing sales, improving profitability, and understanding customer preferences. This project demonstrated expertise in data analysis and visualization, helping businesses in the food & beverage industry make strategic, data-informed decisions.
